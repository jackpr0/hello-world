# hello-world
My first repository. Just learning the ropes.

Hi!

I'm Jack and I'm learning how to be a front-end web developer.
I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript using the MDN front-end web developer course.

I like cats and football and I hope to start a project on non-league football in the near future.
